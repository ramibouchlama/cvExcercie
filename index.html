        <p><em>Web Developer, Trainer, VoiceOver Actor and <strong>Founder & CEO of <a href="#">Tawwika</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>
          Started his fascination with computer science since he was 8 years old. His dad played a great role in influencing him by learning raw coding and developing without good learning basis.
          Had to pause his passion to work another job helping people with technologies and making sure relational links are better in telemarketing and cusomer service, to make ends meet for several years.
          Meanwhile he discovered his voice was a good way to do documentaries and ads, only to get back to coding to build his startup converging all he's learning while training others in soft skills,
          coding and doing voiceovers. That's how he's trying to all his loved passions at once because he believes that that's how to he can fully live his life.
